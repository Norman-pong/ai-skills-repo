# AGENTS.md

## Working agreements
- Write a cleanup plan before modifying code for cleanup/refactor/deslop work.
- Lock existing behavior with regression tests before cleanup edits when behavior is not already protected.
- Prefer deletion over addition.
- Reuse existing utils and patterns before introducing new abstractions.
- No new dependencies without explicit request.
- Keep diffs small, reviewable, and reversible.
- Run lint, typecheck, tests, and static analysis after changes.
- Final reports must include changed files, simplifications made, and remaining risks.

## Lore Commit Protocol

Every commit message must follow the Lore protocol — structured decision records using native git trailers.
Commits are not just labels on diffs; they are the atomic unit of institutional knowledge.

### Format

```
<intent line: why the change was made, not what changed>

<body: narrative context — constraints, approach rationale>

Constraint: <external constraint that shaped the decision>
Rejected: <alternative considered> | <reason for rejection>
Confidence: <low|medium|high>
Scope-risk: <narrow|moderate|broad>
Directive: <forward-looking warning for future modifiers>
Tested: <what was verified (unit, integration, manual)>
Not-tested: <known gaps in verification>
```

### Rules

1. **Intent line first.** The first line describes *why*, not *what*. The diff already shows what changed.
2. **Trailers are optional but encouraged.** Use the ones that add value; skip the ones that don't.
3. **`Rejected:` prevents re-exploration.** If you considered and rejected an alternative, record it so future agents don't waste cycles re-discovering the same dead end.
4. **`Directive:` is a message to the future.** Use it for "do not change X without checking Y" warnings.
5. **`Constraint:` captures external forces.** API limitations, policy requirements, upstream bugs — things not visible in the code.
6. **`Not-tested:` is honest.** Declaring known verification gaps is more valuable than pretending everything is covered.
7. **All trailers use git-native trailer format** (key-value after a blank line). No custom parsing required.

### Example

```
Prevent silent session drops during long-running operations

The auth service returns inconsistent status codes on token
expiry, so the interceptor catches all 4xx responses and
triggers an inline refresh.

Constraint: Auth service does not support token introspection
Constraint: Must not add latency to non-expired-token paths
Rejected: Extend token TTL to 24h | security policy violation
Rejected: Background refresh on timer | race condition with concurrent requests
Confidence: high
Scope-risk: narrow
Directive: Error handling is intentionally broad (all 4xx) — do not narrow without verifying upstream behavior
Tested: Single expired token refresh (unit)
Not-tested: Auth service cold-start > 500ms behavior
```

### Trailer Vocabulary

| Trailer | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `Constraint:` | External constraint that shaped the decision |
| `Rejected:` | Alternative considered and why it was rejected |
| `Confidence:` | Author's confidence level (low/medium/high) |
| `Scope-risk:` | How broadly the change affects the system (narrow/moderate/broad) |
| `Reversibility:` | How easily the change can be undone (clean/messy/irreversible) |
| `Directive:` | Forward-looking instruction for future modifiers |
| `Tested:` | What verification was performed |
| `Not-tested:` | Known gaps in verification |
| `Related:` | Links to related commits, issues, or decisions |

Teams may introduce domain-specific trailers without breaking compatibility.

## SETUP

Always reply to users in Simplified Chinese

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
